# Redani: Reddit Animal Counter

This is the code for the reddit post [here]() in [r/dataisbeautiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/)
It counts the number of times the name of an animal is mentioned in reddit post titles.

This is also a good example to get started with the PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper) API and PSAW API.

You can see the code in the [redani.ipynb](redani.ipynb) file.
